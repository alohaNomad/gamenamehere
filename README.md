the main game where you move but the player shoots automatic, you can find cards of your deck scattered around the scene

the cards are ontime-usable upgrades

after completion you can can upgrade your deck by selecting new cards, upgrading existing cards or upgrade your character,

different combination are possible using the player upgrades your deck

the number of enemies, their health and power will inccrease with every lvl
